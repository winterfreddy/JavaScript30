    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2);
    age = 300;
    console.log(age, age2);
    age2 = 200;
    console.log(age, age2);

    // same thing goes for strings
    let name = "fred";
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2);
    name = "freddy";

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    let team = players;

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = "Luis";

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log("players: ", players);
    console.log("team: ", team);
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];

    // or another way of ES6
    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const newbie = person; // <- just like the array, it modifies its reference
    // newbie.number = 28;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const newbie2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 28, age: 21 });
    console.log("person object: ", person)
    console.log("newbie2 object: ", newbie2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const newbie3 = {...person}; // <- does not exist yet...

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects.
    // lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

      name: 'John',
      age: '32',

    const devAlias = Object.assign({}, developer);
    // try like changing one attribute
    // devAlias.social.instagram = "@JohnnyUli2";

    console.log("developer: ", developer);
    console.log("devAlias: ", devAlias);
    // both are affected and you will need to find a way to clone deeply through a function

    // cheap way but this is basically "poor man's deep clone"
    const devAlias2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(developer));
    devAlias2.social.instagram = "@JohnnyUliza";
    
    console.log("developer: ", developer);

    // original is unaffected!
